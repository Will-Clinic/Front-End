### Veterans Process
Upon registration, veteran user will be directed to their landing page. On this page, they can begin the application process. Once an application is completed, veteran user will be able to request a meeting with the next available attorney in their immediate area. Once matched with an attorney, the veteran user will be able to pick the meeting details, such as which available time slot they want to meet at, and the location of the meeting.

### Attorneys Process
Upon registration, attorney user will be directed to their landing page. On this page, they will be able to flag themselves as looking for veterans to match with, as well as set up their availability for times and dates they are available for meeting. **To be considered for matching with a veteran in need, attorneys must be verified by an Admin using information provided on Attorney Registration.** Once a veteran has been matched with an attorney, the attorney will be notified of the time slot the veteran has chosen, as well as the location for the meeting.
