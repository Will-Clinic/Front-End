        The content provided on this website or any website linking to this disclaimer (cumulatively, "website") is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice. Transmission of this information is not intended to create, and receipt does not constitute, an attorney-client relationship. By using this website, including the hyperlinks to external websites and electronic mail (email) links, you expressly agree that there is no attorney-client relationship between you and WA Vets Will Clinic ("WAVetsWillClinic"), its participating attorneys, or any other affiliated organization.
        The opinions or viewpoints expressed herein do not necessarily reflect those of  WAVetsWillClinic and any link to other websites are not intended to be referrals or endorsements of those sites. The links provided are maintained by the respective organizations, and they are solely responsible for the content of their own sites. The listing of sponsors, participating organizations, or any other groups or persons on this or any other WAVetsWillClinic website is not an endorsement by WAVetsWillClinic of any service(s) and/or product(s) offered by such persons or entities, and their listing on any WAVetsWillClinic website is not to be construed as such.
        Although the WA Vets Will Clinic provides free legal services to eligible Veterans, all participation is subject to these terms of use, and any future terms of use as amended.

    In order to be eligible for the WA Vets Will Clinic, you must:
    (1) Be a Veteran of a branch of the United States Armed Forces; (2) Have a DD 214 or other official document showing military service (Report of Separation, discharge papers, etc); (3) Be a Washington resident; (4) Have a net worth of less than $500,000.00 ($1,000,000.00 if married).
    For the purposes of this program, your net worth consists of your cash, personal property, stock and bonds, real estate (equity only), savings, life insurance, inheritances, and retirement assets like a 40l(k), military retirement, or an IRA. If you have a large, complicated, or want to establish a Trust, this program is not available to you.
    WA Vets Will Clinic does not handle beneficiary designations on any assets. If you have life insurance policies, certain types of retirement plans, payable-on-death accounts, 401(k)s, annuities, or other assets with a named beneficiary, these assets will pass outside of your will to the named person(s). If no beneficiary is named, these assets will likely pass to your estate and be disbursed according to your Will. However, these assets and/or designations are not handled by the WA Vets Will Clinic. You should check with your provider regularly to make sure your beneficiary designations on these assets are current. If you have minor children, the Washington Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) prevents assets from transferring outright to those children until age eighteen (18). In such a case, the asset(s) transferred to the child would be held by a custodian, until they reach eighteen (18). Avoiding the UTMA requires creating a Trust in your Will that holds the assets, and is overseen by a Trustee, until your children reaches an age of your choosing. Trusts of this nature, and other UTMA issues are NOT handled by the WA Vets Will Clinic. This is a brief overview of the UTMA, if you have concerns or require additional advice, you should seek an attorney outside of the WA Vets Will Clinic and should not enroll.
    Further, WA Vets Will Clinic does not give advice / legal representation with respect to: 1) estate, gift, income and/or Generation Skipping Transfer tax issues; 2) special needs or charitable trusts; 3) citizenship / domicile issues; 4) assets managed or held outside of the U.S; 5) short or long term care planning; 6) immigration issues; and 7) litigation of any kind; 8) Minor and/or children's trusts; 9) Any issue implicating RCW 11.114 - Uniform transfers to minors act; 10) specific bequests of property other than those permitted by a list (those permitted in RCW 11.12.260)
    No lawyer or law firm involved in the WA Vets Will Clinic program has performed a conflict search on your name or your spouse or partner's name. If you are aware of any legal proceeding involving you and your WA Vets Will Clinic attorney, please alert the attorney at the beginning of your WA Vets Will Clinic interview so that the attorney will arrange for another attorney to meet with you. All discussions with an attorney will be kept confidential. The WA Vets Will Clinic does not keep a copy of your Will or other estate planning documents; it will be up to you to keep your original documents in a safe and fireproof place. Some individuals need complex plans that may require assistance beyond what is available in this program. The attorney assigned to work with you will advise you if a referral is necessary in your case. You should understand that significant legal rights may be affected by having a married couple attend the same WA Vets Will Clinic estate planning appointment. The WA Vets Will Clinic only advises veterans who submit this form and are accepted to participate in the Clinic, not spouses, beneficiaries, or related individuals. You and your spouse have the option to both seek independent counsel regarding your estate plan, by attending the WA Vets Will Clinic with your spouse you acknowledge and waive this right.
    All transmissions to and from the WA Vets Will Clinic, including, but not limited to, use of the online intake from or any other intake form disseminated by the the WA Vets Will Clinic or its affiliates, cannot be guaranteed to be secure. Further, WA Vets Will Clinic and associated organizations and persons cannot guaranty the security of you transmission or storage of information.
