<h2>Health Care Power Of Attorney</h2>

<form method="post">

    <h4>
        A health care power of attorney gives a person of your choosing, your "attorney-in-fact," the power to manage your
        health care. Typically, a health care directive is used in estate planning in part to ensure your health care
        directive and your wishes concerning medical treatment are carried out. Your attorney-in-fact for health care
        decisions has the power to admit or discharge you into a health care facility, consent to treatment, pay health
        care expenses, and authorize disclosure of your medical records. Like a general power of attorney, it is important
        to choose someone you trust that will carry out your wishes.
