    <h4>
        A general power of attorney document gives a person of your choosing, your "attorney-in-fact," the power to act for
        you and perform all acts concerning your property and any interest therein. A power of attorney is often used in
        estate planning in case you are incapacitated, but would like a person of your choosing to be able to manage
        your affairs. Thus, it is important the person you choose to act as your attorney-in-fact is someone you trust who
        will carry out your wishes, as they will have control over your assets.
